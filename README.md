# online-retail_Pandas_cleaning

## Overview

The **online-retail_Pandas_cleaning** project is designed to preprocess a retail dataset using the Pandas library in Python. The primary goal is to clean the data for further analysis by addressing issues such as duplicates and missing values, while also deriving useful features from the existing dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of transactional records from an online retail store, with the following attributes:

- **Invoice**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **StockCode**: Identifier for the product.
- **Description**: Description of the product (some entries may be missing).
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **Price**: Price of the product.
- **Customer ID**: Identifier for the customer (may have missing entries).
- **Country**: Country of the customer.

The dataset contains a total of **541,910** entries and **8** columns. Below is a summary of the data types and non-null counts:

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 541910 entries, 0 to 541909
Data columns (total 8 columns):
 #   Column       Non-Null Count   Dtype  
---  ------       --------------   -----  
 0   Invoice      541910 non-null  object 
 1   StockCode    541910 non-null  object 
 2   Description  540456 non-null  object 
 3   Quantity     541910 non-null  int64  
 4   InvoiceDate  541910 non-null  object 
 5   Price        541910 non-null  float64
 6   Customer ID  406830 non-null  float64
 7   Country      541910 non-null  object 
dtypes: float64(2), int64(1), object(5)
memory usage: 33.1+ MB
```

## Data Cleaning Steps

The following steps were performed to clean and prepare the dataset:

1. **Loading the CSV File**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Removing Duplicate Records**: Duplicate entries are identified and removed to ensure data integrity.

3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing values in the `Description` and `Customer ID` columns are addressed using appropriate strategies (e.g., mean, median, or mode) as needed.
   - Other columns with null values are either filled or removed based on their significance.

4. **Deriving New Columns**: New features are derived from existing data to enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities. For example, converting `InvoiceDate` to a datetime object for time-series analysis.

5. **Final Transformations**: Any necessary transformations are applied to the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.

## Usage

To run the data cleaning process, ensure you have Python and Pandas installed. You can execute the script with the following command:

```bash
python data_cleaning.ipynb
```

Make sure to replace `data_cleaning.ipynb` with the actual name of your script file.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational approach to data cleaning using Pandas. The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis or integration into larger projects. Future work could involve advanced analysis techniques or machine learning applications based on the cleaned data.
